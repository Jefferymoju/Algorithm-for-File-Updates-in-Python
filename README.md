# Algorithm for File Updates in Python  

## 📌 Project Description  
(SCENARIO) At my workplace, access to sensitive resources is managed through an allow list of IP addresses stored in the `allow_list.txt` file. There is also a separate remove list that specifies IP addresses which should have their access revoked.  

I developed a Python script that automates the process of updating the allow list by removing any IP addresses that are no longer permitted.

## 🎯 Objective  
- Automate the process of managing access by updating the allow list.  
- Remove restricted IP addresses from the `allow_list.txt` file based on a `remove_list`.

## 📚 Scope  
This project demonstrates:  
- File handling in Python (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`).  
- Data manipulation using `.split()`, `.remove()`, and `.join()`.  
- Iterating through lists and applying conditions.  
- Automating access control updates in a security context.

## 🛠️ Skills Learned  
- Writing efficient Python algorithms for automation.  
- Understanding file input/output (I/O) operations.  
- Converting between strings and lists in Python.  
- Implementing conditional checks and loops.  
- Strengthening problem-solving skills for access control scenarios in cybersecurity.

## 🔧 Tools & Methods  
**Language:** Python  

**Methods used:**  
- `open()` with context managers (`with` statement)  
- `.read()`, `.write()` for file handling  
- `.split()`, `.join()` for string manipulation  
- `.remove()` for list modification  
- `for` loops for iteration
